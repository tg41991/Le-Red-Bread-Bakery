# Le Red Bread Bakery

A WordPress hosted website for the Le Red Bread Bakery. The site feature blog posts and a list of products. The tools and methods used include HTML & CSS, Javascript, php, Sass and Gulp.

I found this project to be especially beneficial for my understanding of web design as I had to think carefully about the application of different styles using CSS and how they affect commonly used elements. Using php to link pages together was easier than I thought it would be. As with Angular it took less time in php to understand the flow of information compared to React.
